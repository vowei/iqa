# Esri Karma Tutorial

If you're building web mapping apps using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/), and need a way to automate running your unit tests, this tutorial will show you how using the [Karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) BDD-style testing framework.

If you (don't already know and) want to know why Karma is so awesome, I suggest watching this video, starting at the point where the frist tests are run:

In a nut shell, Karma:
* is easy to intall and configure w/ NPM
* serves up your app and test files in a local web server, which includes a reverse-proxy to prevent cross-origin requestes
* launches one or more browsers pointing to above web server and runs your tests
* watches for changes in your source and test files and re-runs all your tests as soon as you save a file
* works with most popular testing frameworks (Jasmine, Mocha, Qunit)
* works with AMD (Require.js and Dojo) code
* can generage code coverage reports and much more via plugins

This tutorial demonstrates the configuration settings to get Karma running Jasmine BDD-style tests on code that relies on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

[Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) is a popular and simple BDD-style JavaScript testing framework. Details on using Jasmine can be found at the [Jasmine Wiki]
(http://jasmine.github.io/).

**NOTE:** The current release of this tutorial runs on Jasmine 2.0 and uses  `done()` style async testing. If you want to use this tutorial with existing specs written for Jasmine 1.x (i.e. using the deprecated `runs()` and `waitsFor()` async syntax), you can check out the [v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-karma-tutorial/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of this tutorial.


## Running the Tests

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-karma-tutorial`
2. Go to local copy of repo: `cd esri-karma-tutorial`
3. Install Node (if not already installed) from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)
4. Install Karma (if not already installed) `npm install karma -g`
5. Install development dependencies (Karma plugins for Jasmine, Dojo, browsers, etc): `npm install`
6. Run my tests: `karma start karma.conf.js` or just `karma start`
7. Add your own specs and code under `/spec` and `/src` and let karma run your tests for you!

## More fun with Karma

### Testing in Additional Browsers

You can test in additional browsers by updating `karma.conf.js` for each additional brower:

1. Add the browser name in the `browsers` section
2. Register the browser's launcher in the `plugins` section

Note that for each additional browser you may need to first:

1. Install the browser launcher
2. Set the path to each in an environment vairable

For example:
```
npm install karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
....
set FIREFOX_BIN="c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"
```

See the [Browsers page of the Karma documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/config/browsers.html) for more information.

### Code Coverage

You can get [Istanbul](https://github.com/yahoo/istanbul) code coverage reports for your tests by installing the [karma-coverage](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage) plugin:

```
npm install karma-coverage --save-dev
```

After insalling the plugin, uncomment the coverage related lines in the `preprocessors`, `reporters`, `coverageReporter`, and `plugins` sections of `karma.conf.js` and run karma.

See the [karma-coverage](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage) plugin README for more information.

### Other Test Frameworks

This repo shows you how to use Karma to run unit tests using the Jasmine test framework, but Karma can be used with other test frameworks. For an example of how to use Karma to run [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) tests with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://js.arcgis.com), see:

https://github.com/Esri/landscape-modeler-js

## How It Works

This tutorial relies on the [karma-dojo plugin](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-dojo) which enables testing of AMD style Dojo code.

After insalling and configuring the plug in, the trick is to set the `dojoConfig` in main.js to use the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://js.arcgis.com) for the Dojo and Esri packages as follows:

```
var dojoConfig = {
    packages: [
        // local pacakges to test
        {
            name:"esri-utils",
            location:"/base/src/esri-utils"
        },
        // hosted packages
        {
            name: 'esri',
            location: 'http://js.arcgis.com/3.6/js/esri'
        }, {
            name: 'dojo',
            location: 'http://js.arcgis.com/3.6/js/dojo/dojo'
        }, {
            name: 'dojox',
            location: 'http://js.arcgis.com/3.6/js/dojo/dojox'
        }, {
            name: 'dijit',
            location: 'http://js.arcgis.com/3.6/js/dojo/dijit'
        }
    ],
    async: true
};

```
